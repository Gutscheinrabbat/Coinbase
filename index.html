<section id="about-cryptocurrencies">
    <h2>What Are Cryptocurrencies?</h2>
    <p>Cryptocurrencies are digital or virtual assets that use cryptography to secure transactions, control the creation of new units, and verify the transfer of assets. Unlike traditional fiat currencies issued by governments, cryptocurrencies operate on decentralized networks using blockchain technology, making them resistant to censorship and manipulation.</p>
    <p>The most well-known cryptocurrency is <strong>Bitcoin (BTC)</strong>, created in 2009 by an unknown person or group of people under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. Since then, thousands of other cryptocurrencies have been developed, including <strong>Ethereum (ETH)</strong>, which allows for smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps), and <strong>USDT (Tether)</strong>, a stablecoin pegged to the value of the US dollar.</p>
